## Information from the Developer

"Weight Tracker" was created as my first individual full-stack project.  Some of the technologies I used are described below:

- SpringBoot + Spring Security to create a Maven project, creating my REST API
- Angular to consume the REST API and set up the front-end, with several components throughout
- "Apex Charts" to create the graph component
- PostgresSQL to store all of my data & schemas
